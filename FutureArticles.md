Different mathematical constructs to represent RL environments:
- Markov Decision Processes
- Markov games (Litmann 1994)
 Adopting this specialization,  which we  call a  two-player zero-sum  Markov game, simplifies the mathematics but makes it impossible to consider important phenomena such as cooperation. However, it is a first step and can be considered a strict generalization of both MDPâ€™s (when |A_opponent| = 1) and matrix games (when |S| = 1).
- Partially observable markov decision processes
- decentralized markov decision processes.
