I am Daniel Hernandez Perez! A PhD student at the University of York, UK. I specialize in Reinforcement Learning applied to video games. My research dwells on multi agent reinforcement learning and search based methods, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search.

I am also part of the [IGGI PhD programme](http://www.iggi.org.uk/) and [Digital Creativity Labs](https://www.digitalcreativity.ac.uk/)
